The <a id="a_2" href="https://cordeliayu.com/article/2016/11/holistic-sustainability/cordeliayu.com/s/4E">original version</a> of this talk was prepared for Sustainable UX 2016 in February.)</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_2">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_2">I had a talk prepared. It did not require any of these.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_3">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_3" class="callout">Content Warning</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_4">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_4">I did not have to tell you that my talk might include discussion of sexist harassment, racism, or immigrant intimidation. I did not have to tell you that I will have no graphic images, and I will blank the screen when it is time. I did not have to tell you it is completely okay to leave if you are not in a good mental state right now.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_5">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_5">I did not have to tell you that it is very likely that I will start crying half way through.</p>

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_7">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_7" class="callout">What is within the scope of UX? And what is the designer’s role in fighting climate change?</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_8">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_8">I was going to tell you how I would deconstruct three examples in tech to get to this question:</p>

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_12">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_12">I would talk about how even recycling centers—the most championed tool of environmental responsibility in the US—contribute to marginalizing Black communities.</p>

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_16">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_16">But I had inspirational quotations to make us feel hopeful.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_17">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_17" class="callout">Green America promotes social and environmental justice through economic action.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_18">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_18">I would have talked about how I used to work <a id="a_1" href="http://greenamerica.org">here</a> but how most projects from major environmental orgs are made for rich white folks…</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_19">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_19" class="callout">The language of sustainability—as commonly practiced—is in the language of affluence.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_20">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_20">…while completely ignoring the marginalized groups most affected by climate change.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_21">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_21" class="callout">Designer is just a fancy word for “creators of solutions to problems”.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_22">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_22">I would have had more fancy quotable lines to make us all feel good about what we do.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_23">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_23" class="callout">We must understand cultural contexts of our work and the systems we work in and perpetuate, intentionally or otherwise.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_24">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_24">Even if some of the ways we do it are problematic and need some work. And that would have been 9 minutes 47 seconds.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_25">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_25" class="callout">We design for the problems we know.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_26">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_26">I would have then spent 11 minutes 24 seconds on how this happened and how to fix it. and if you’re quick at math you would notice I was going to go a few seconds over 20 minutes because this is supposed to be a 38 minute talk. So sorry for breaking the rules in a parallel universe.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_27">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_27">You all would have been inspired and applauded. Which would have been great for me since I am an introvert who doesn’t like bothering people so one of you might have come up to me and we could talk about social justice and the environment and made a new friendship and i’d be know as the optimistic content strategist with a penchant for social justice, which is a pretty good brand if you’re <a id="a_1" href="http://cv.cordeliayu.com">looking for a job</a>.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_28">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_28">[trashfire]</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_29">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_29">But then Tuesday happened.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_30">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_30">Which is terrible for me because now you get the angry queer climate justice witch of color with a content strategy habit. And when you are an angry [blank] of color. White people automatically see visions of race riots in their head. Not very hirable.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_31">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_31">You see, when Tuesday happened—one of the things I immediately saw was this.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_32">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_32" class="callout">3℃</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_33">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_33">Because on November 8, 25% of the US population likely condemned the entire world to at least a 3 degree inrease in global surface temperature because without federal movement, no amount of server efficiences, electri cars, or behavior shaping design will ever offset the amount fossil fuel drilling or community destroying policies of Donald Trump’s energy agenda.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_34">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_34">So I asked myself. What went wrong? In a world where 3℃ is likely an inevitability, what can we as designers do? Are there any possible paths out of this?</p>

</figure><span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_38">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_38">There is a wealth of research that says the first thing we read on a subject is set in our minds as true by default, especially when it matches our worldview. And evidence to the contrary has a “boomerang effect” that reinforces false beliefs. So when you have a content algorithm that reinforces the echo chamber and outright lies (and no corrections), you create a civic dialog space that is constantly filled with falsehoods during a contentions election year.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_39">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_39">Because when I see these political lies on facebook and connect them to 3℃, I see New Orleans still rebuilding.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_40">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_40">I remember white environmentalists in the largest nonprofits telling me that it is too hard to partner with environmental groups from marginalized communities. That creating programs to galvanize those with the most at stake in the fight for climate justice is not financially sustainable.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_41">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_41">I remember friends who worked on Obama’s campaign who are now unable to vote because they have been doxxed in the last few years and voter rolls are public records. I see Trump saying that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by China as the lede but the fact check doesn’t happen until paragraphs later.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_42">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_42">I see xenophobic attacks of my Muslim friends. I see Facebook comments full of white men saying there is no sexism in this election and telling women to eat a bag of dicks in the same sentence. I see that there were at least four trans suicides in 24 hours after Trump won. I see Twitter full of people with chronic illnesses worrying about medical care.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_43">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_43">I remember getting on a bus to go speak on social justice and a man yells “Go back to China!” and none of the white people defending me. I see news of people stalking gay bars an attacking men as the exit. I see stories of husbands holding women’s children hostage for Trump votes on a private Facebook group.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_44">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_44">I hear the news of an education secretary who doesn’t believe fossils exist. Black children drinking lead tainted water. The Marshall Islands sinking below the sea. The Dakota Access protestors being treated like animals and their connection to the outside world jammed.

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_48">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_48">This is a problem. We need to fix it. Here’s how:</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#h2_1">Permalink</a>]</span> <h2 id="h2_1">Hire for inclusion</h2>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_49">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_49">First. Is a large portion of your team monochromatic? Mostly men? Figure out why. Are you queer friendly? Are you family-friendly? We’re UXers, if we can’t even come up with a decently diverse sample size in our hiring pool, how the hell are we going to come up with one in our user research?</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#h2_2">Permalink</a>]</span> <h2 id="h2_2">Empower people to speak up</h2>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_50">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_50">Second. Finding people with experiences outside your own is only the first part: then you’ve got to empower them to dissent and make change.</p>

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#h2_3">Permalink</a>]</span> <h2 id="h2_3">Make space to listen</h2>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_52">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_52">Third. If inclusion is not built into your product from the beginning, it’s going to be very hard to tack it on in the future. Make space for marginalized groups at the start. Inclusion is not an add on feature, it needs to be core functionality.</p>
<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_53">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_53">Especially in climate justice. communities of color aren’t only the most impacted, they are the ones who care most and are more likely to do climate justice work in their communities that whites are. it’s that white groups don’t bother to listen.</p>

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_60">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_60">This is not merely journalism to voice the opinions of political leaders, this is journalism as a bridge for creating citizen-informed policy.

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_61">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_61">So to come back to the US, the majority of Americans care about sustainability and climate change, yet have few avenues to affect either government nor corporate policy. what if we created space for them to start talking to us? and have their voices lend weight to the governance of our work?</p>

<span class="permalink">[<a href="index.html#p_70">Permalink</a>]</span> <p id="p_70">We all have privileges and we all have disadvantages. Our unique set of each shapes our particular worldview, knowledge, and ignorances. They are like sets of lenses that shape how we see the world, how we see ourselves, and how the world sees us.</p>
